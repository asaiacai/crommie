      <p>During our professional hours, UPE offers free mock techinal interviews to the general public. Each interview lasts 30 minutes and is hosted by one of our Professional Development committee members. Interiews are primarily whiteboard coding interviews, but we can accomodate others by request. We also provide post-interview critique on how to do better the next time around. </p>

      <p>In addition to mock interviews, during our professional hours, we also provide free resume critique to the general public. We request a paper copy of your resume to make critiquing easier. One of our Professional Development committee members will provide personalized advice and critique based on their experiences. Each session can last between 15-30 minutes depending on current availability.</p>
      <p>These are available via walk in. Please check the schedule for professional hours. </p>

      <div class='spacing'></div>
      <p>During our academic hours, we provide tutoring help primarily for the lower division Computer Science classes. While we do also provide tutoring hours during our professional hours, resources will first be alloted to those that come in for professional assistance.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, we do not provide debugging help on projects. We primarily focus on answering conceptual questions on course material, but all questions are welcome.</p>

    desc: "To really see what was happening at the single-atom level we had to use a uniquely sensitive atomic force microscope in Michael Crommie’s laboratory... Nobody has ever taken direct, single-bond-resolved images of individual molecules, right before and immediately after a complex organic reaction."

-   title: "From the Bottom Up: Manipulating Nanoribbons at the Molecular Level"
    desc: "Previously, scientists made nanoribbons that have a constant width throughout. “That makes for a nice wire or a simple switching element,” says Crommie, “but it does not provide a lot of functionality. We wanted to see if we could change the width within a single nanoribbon, controlling the structure inside the nanoribbon at the atomic scale to give it new behavior that is potentially useful.” -LBL Newscenter"

    desc: "We’re reporting a scanning tunneling microscopy and non-contact atomic force microscopy study of F4TCNQ molecules at the surface of graphene in which the molecules coalesce into 2D close-packed islands. The resulting islands could be used to control the charge-carrier density in graphene substrates, as well as to modify how electrons move through graphene-based devices. They might also be used to form precise nanoscale patterns that exhibit atomic-scale structural perfection unmatched by conventional fabrication techniques."

    desc: "The first experimental observation of a quantum mechanical phenomenon that was predicted nearly 70 years ago holds important implications for the future of graphene-based electronic devices. Working with microscopic artificial atomic nuclei fabricated on graphene, we have imaged the “atomic collapse” states theorized to occur around super-large atomic nuclei."

-   title: "Defects Through the Looking Glass"
    desc: "Normally, STM is used to study conductors and cannot be used to study bulk insulators, since electrical current does not typically flow through an insulator. We overcame this obstacle by capping the h-BN with a single sheet of graphene. This permits us to visualize the charged defects embedded in the underlying BN crystal. Essentially, we use graphene as a window to look into the insulator"

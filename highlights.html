  - title: Local Electronic Structure of Molecular Heterojunctions in a Single-Layer 2D Covalent Organic Framework
    desc: "The synthesis of a single-layer covalent organic framework (COF) with spatially modulated internal potentials provides new opportunities for manipulating the electronic structure of molecularly defined materials. Here, the fabrication and electronic characterization of COF-420: a single-layer porphyrin-based square-lattice COF containing a periodic array of oriented, type II electronic heterojunctions is reported. In contrast to previous donor-acceptor COFs, COF-420 is constructed from building blocks that yield identical cores upon reticulation, but that are bridged by electrically asymmetric linkers supporting oriented electronic dipoles. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals staggered gap (type II) band alignment between adjacent molecular cores in COF-420, in agreement with first-principles calculations. Hirshfeld charge analysis indicates that dipole fields from oriented imine linkages within COF-420 are the main cause of the staggered electronic structure in this square grid of atomically-precise heterojunctions"

  - title: Topological Band Engineering of Graphene Nanoribbons
    desc: Here we present the rational design and experimental realization of a topologically engineered GNR superlattice that hosts a one-dimensional array of such states, thus generating otherwise inaccessible electronic structures. This strategy also enables new end states to be engineered directly into the termini of the one-dimensional GNR superlattice. Atomically precise topological GNR superlattices were synthesized from molecular precursors on a gold surface, Au(111), under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions and characterized by low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy. Our experimental results and first-principles calculations reveal that the frontier band structure (the bands bracketing filled and empty states) of these GNR superlattices is defined purely by the coupling between adjacent topological interface states. This manifestation of non-trivial one-dimensional topological phases presents a route to band engineering in one-dimensional materials based on precise control of their electronic topology, and is a promising platform for studies of one-dimensional quantum spin physics.

  - title: Hierarchical On-Surface Synthesis of Graphene Nanoribbon Heterojunctions
    desc: We describe a hierarchical fabrication strategy that allows the growth of bottom-up GNRs that preferentially exhibit a single heterojunction interface rather than a random statistical sequence of junctions along the ribbon. Such heterojunctions provide a viable platform that could be directly used in functional GNR-based device applications at the molecular scale. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations confirm that hierarchically grown heterojunctions between chevron GNR (cGNR) and binaphthyl-cGNR segments exhibit straddling Type I band alignment in structures that are only one atomic layer thick and 3 nm in width.

  - title: Atomically precise graphene nanoribbon heterojunctions from a single molecular precursor
    desc: Here we report the fabrication and electronic characterization of atomically precise GNR heterojunctions prepared through late-stage functionalization of chevron GNRs obtained from a single precursor. Post-growth excitation of fully cyclized GNRs induces cleavage of sacrificial carbonyl groups, resulting in atomically well-defined heterojunctions within a single GNR. The GNR heterojunction structure was characterized using bond-resolved scanning tunnelling microscopy, which enables chemical bond imaging at T = 4.5 K. Scanning tunnelling spectroscopy reveals that band alignment across the heterojunction interface yields a type II heterojunction, in agreement with first-principles calculations. GNR heterojunction band realignment proceeds over a distance less than 1 nm, leading to extremely large effective fields.

  - title: Quantum spin Hall state in monolayer 1T'-WTe2
    desc: By investigating the electronic structure of epitaxially grown monolayer 1T'-WTe2 using angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) and first-principles calculations, we observe clear signatures of topological band inversion and bandgap opening, which are the hallmarks of a QSH state. Scanning tunnelling microscopy measurements further confirm the correct crystal structure and the existence of a bulk bandgap, and provide evidence for a modified electronic structure near the edge that is consistent with the expectations for a QSH insulator. Our results establish monolayer 1T'-WTe2 as a new class of QSH insulator with large bandgap in a robust two-dimensional materials family of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs).

  - title: Tuning charge and correlation effects for a single molecule on a graphene device
    desc: The ability to understand and control the electronic properties of individual molecules in adevice environment is crucial for developing future technologies at the nanometre scale andbelow. Achieving this, however, requires the creation of three-terminal devices that allowsingle molecules to be both gated and imaged at the atomic scale. We have accomplished thisby integrating a graphene field effect transistor with a scanning tunnelling microscope,thus  allowing  gate-controlled  charging  and  spectroscopic  interrogation  of  individualtetrafluoro-tetracyanoquinodimethane  molecules.  We  observe  a  non-rigid  shift  in  themolecule’s lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy (relative to the Dirac point) as afunction  of  gate  voltage  due  to  graphene  polarization  effects.  Our  results  show  thatelectron–electron interactions play an important role in how molecular energy levels align tothe graphene Dirac point, and may significantly influence charge transport through individualmolecules incorporated in graphene-based nanodevices.

  - title: Imaging single-molecule reaction intermediates stabilized by surface dissipation and entropy
    desc: "Chemical transformations at the interface between solid/liquid or solid/gaseous phases of matter lie at the heart of key industrial-scale manufacturing processes. A comprehensive study of the molecular energetics and conformational dynamics that underlie these transformations is often limited to ensemble-averaging analytical techniques. Here we report the detailed investigation of a surface-catalysed cross-coupling and sequential cyclization cascade of 1,2-bis(2-ethynyl phenyl)ethyne on Ag(100). Using non-contact atomic force microscopy, we imaged the single-bond-resolved chemical structure of transient metastable intermediates. Theoretical simulations indicate that the kinetic stabilization of experimentally observable intermediates is determined not only by the potential-energy landscape, but also by selective energy dissipation to the substrate and entropic changes associated with key transformations along the reaction pathway. The microscopic insights gained here pave the way for the rational design and control of complex organic reactions at the surface of heterogeneous catalysts."

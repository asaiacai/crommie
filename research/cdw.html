      <p>Charge density waves (CDWs) and conventional superconductivity share similarities in that they are both collective phenomena that can arise from electron-phonon coupling, and they both can also be influenced by dimensionality and electron-electron interactions. The Crommie group is currently exploring these phenomena in different single-layer 2D materials, such as the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) (materials of the form MX<sub>2</sub>, where M = transition metal and X = chalcogen) as well as bilayer systems (for more information on bilayer systems look <a href="/research/topeng">here</a>).</p>
      <p>1D CDWs are most commonly described as a Peierls distortion, which arises from a combination of Fermi surface nesting and electron-phonon coupling that leads to the softening of a phonon at wavevector q = 2k<sub>F</sub>.<sup>1</sup> This causes dimerization of the lattice and a charge distortion at q = 2k<sub>F</sub> as well as the opening of an energy gap at k<sub>F</sub> <b>(Fig. 1)</b>.</p>
      <p>In TMD materials the situation can be a bit more complex due to the existence of multiple bands, electron-electron correlations, and spin-orbit coupling.  The mechanisms causing CDWs are still debated in different TMD materials, with some favoring electronic-based mechanisms due to Fermi surface nesting or van Hove singularities and others favoring strong electron-phonon coupling.<sup>2</sup> Motivation for understanding this behavior comes from the fact that CDW order can affect other aspects of TMD behavior, such as superconductivity, Mott insulator formation, magnetic ordered states, and quantum spin liquid formation.</p>

      <p>A strategy that the Crommie group has pursued to explore this topic in TMD materials is to characterize the local electronic structure as a material is thinned down to the single-layer limit.<sup>3-6</sup> This removes the effects of interlayer coupling, thus simplifying the band structure (since electrons can’t hop between layers) and reducing electronic screening (which enhances electron-electron correlations). In some cases TMD CDWs have been predicted to significantly change their properties upon thinning. An example is NbSe<sub>2</sub>, where thinning down to a single-layer was predicted to reduce the number of bands crossing E<sub>F</sub>, thus altering the NbSe<sub>2</sub> Fermi surface <b>(Figs. 2a, b)</b> and causing the NbSe<sub>2</sub> CDW to change its periodicity.<sup>7</sup>.</p>

      <p>The Crommie group tested these predictions by measuring single-layer NbSe<sub>2</sub> sheets grown via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) (NbSe<sub>2</sub> growth was performed by the S.K. Mo and Z.X. Shen groups, STM measurements were performed by the Crommie group). As predicted,<sup>7</sup> the electronic structure of single-layer NbSe2 was found to differ significantly from bulk values <b>(Figs. 3a, b)</b>.<sup>4</sup></p>

      <p>The single-layer NbSe2 CDW, however, was observed to have the same periodicity and T<sub>c</sub> as bulk NbSe<sub>2</sub> <b>(Fig. 4)</b>. This suggests that electron-phonon coupling plays a stronger role in this material than postulated Fermi surface nesting or van Hove singularity-based mechanisms.<sup>4</sup></p>

      <p>We also observed that the superconducting critical temperature of NbSe<sub>2</sub> reduces from T<sub>c</sub> = = 7K in the bulk to only T<sub>c</sub> ≈ 1.5K in single layers (T<sub>c</sub> values measured in collaboration with A. Zettl’s group) <b>(Fig. 5)</b>. Thinning NbSe<sub>2</sub> down to the single-layer limit thus has no effect on the CDW but weakens superconductivity.<sup>4</sup></p>
      <p>The Crommie group has additionally explored the formation of different CDW phases in single-layer TaSe<sub>2</sub> (in collaboration with S.K. Mo and Z.X. Shen). In the 1H phase single-layer TaSe<sub>2</sub> was observed to exhibit a 3x3 CDW very similar to what is observed in NbSe<sub>2</sub> <b>(Fig. 6)</b>.<sup>5</sup></p>

      <p>In the 1T phase, however, single-layer TaSe<sub>2</sub> is observed to have a completely different CDW structure. Here we observe a star-of-David √13 x √13 CDW distortion as shown in <b>Fig. 7</b>.<sup>8</sup> Each maximum observed via STM in this CDW pattern <b>(Fig. 7a)</b> corresponds to a single star-of-David cluster (see sketch in <b>Fig. 7c</b>). Each cluster contains 13 Ta atoms, including the atom at the center. Reciprocal lattice vectors of the CDW (<b>b<sub>1</sub></b> and <b>b<sub>2</sub></b>, obtained by Fourier transforming the STM image) are much smaller than the reciprocal lattice vectors of the atomic lattice <b>(Figs. 7b, d)</b>).</p>
